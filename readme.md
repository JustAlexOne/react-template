React-template
-----------------

This is a very basic project using React that you can use to bootstrap your own projects. Everything is already setup for dev. test and linting. This project is using ES2015 syntax with the help of Babel.

first run `npm install`

then you can run the following commands :

* `npm start` : run the dev mode build with a dev server at `http://localhost:8080/public/`
* `npm run build` : create a single minified JS file in `dist` if `test` and `lint` passes
* `npm run lint` : lint your javascript files using eslint
* `npm test` : run your tests

In dev mode, you can open your app at `http://localhost:8080/public/`.
Each time you change your Javascript code, everything will be re-processed and the app will reload automatically using webpack-dev-server and embedded live reload.

You should use Node 4 or 5 to run the project.
