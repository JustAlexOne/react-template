React-template
-----------------

This is a very simple project using React that you can use to bootstrap projects.

first run `npm install`

then you can run the following commands :

* `npm start` : run the dev mode build with a dev server at `http://localhost:8080/public/`
* `npm run build` : create a single minified JS file in `dist`
* `npm run lint` : lint your javascript files using eslint
* `npm test` : run your tests

In dev mode, you can open your app at `http://localhost:8080/public/`.
Each time you change your Javascript code, erything will be re-processed and the app will reload automatically using webpack-dev-server and hot module replacement.
